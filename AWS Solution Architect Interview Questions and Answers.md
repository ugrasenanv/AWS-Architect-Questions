# AWS Solution Architect Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is AWS?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a secure cloud services platform, offering computing power, database storage, content delivery, and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.

## 2. What are the key components of AWS?
The key components of AWS are:
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- RDS (Relational Database Service)
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Lambda
- IAM (Identity and Access Management)

## 3. What is EC2?
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to launch virtual servers (instances) on demand.

## 4. What is S3?
S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It is used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

## 8. What is IAM?
IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a web service that helps users securely control access to AWS services and resources for their users. It allows users to create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

## 9. What is an AMI?
An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch an instance in EC2.

## 10. What is CloudFormation?
CloudFormation is a service that helps users model and set up their AWS resources so that they can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on their applications. It allows users to create a template that describes all the AWS resources that they want (like EC2 instances or RDS DB instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for them.

## 11. What is Auto Scaling?
